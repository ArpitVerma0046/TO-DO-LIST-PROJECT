# Overview of TO-DO LIST Project
This project is developed using front end technologies HTML + CSS + jQUERY. The user can add a new todo via input element and the added todo is appended in the existing unordered list. The user can check and uncheck a todo and can also delete a todo. We have used jQuery On() method to do the animations and even used font awesome to create trash can and plus sign.
